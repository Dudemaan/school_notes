Functions are any rule that recieves input, and outputs exactly one output based on that rule. The input and output must be some kind of quantity.

We can study functions using three tools:
1. [[./derivitives.org][Derivitives]]: approximate the function and its slope at a infinitely small point
2. [[./integrals.org][Integrals]]: add a bunch of small pieces of the function into a big piece, get the area
3. [[./power_series.org][Power Series]]: represent complex functions as infinite polynomials

To define a function, we need it [[./domain.org][domain]], [[./codomain.org][codomain]] and an exact rule to take an input and get an output. It can be written as:

$$ f \colon & \mathbf{A} \longrightarrow \mathbf{b} $$
     $$ x \mapsto x^2 $$

Two functions are equal if and only if their domains and codomains are equal, and for every input in the domain, both functions give the same output.
