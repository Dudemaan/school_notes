#+title: Tuples

Similar to [[./lists.org][lists]], but the values cannot be changed when set. This means it is immutable. It is denoted by round brackets and commas, an interesting case with only one element:

    tup = (3,)

One key use case is:

    x = 1
    y = 1
    x,y = y,x <= swaps variables
