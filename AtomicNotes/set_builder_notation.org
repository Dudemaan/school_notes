#+title: Set Builder Notation

Set builder notation is a way of defining sets using a rule or set of rules. To determine if an element is in a set or not, apply it to all of the rules and if it passes each, it is in the set. The general form of set builder notation are as follow:

$\{$variable name (possible additional restrictions)  $\mid$ test(s) that the elements have to pass$\}$

An example form can be seen below:

$$ \{a \in \mathbb{N} \mid a \geq 5 \mathbin{\&} a \leq 8 \}$$
