$A \cup B$ full combination of both sets, union. To prove that $x\in A \cap B$, show that $x \in A$ or $x \in B$ or that both are true.

$A \cap B$ only the parts of the sets that appear in both sets, intersection. To prove that $x\in A \cup B$, show that $x\in A$ AND $x\in B$.

$A \subset B$ when one set contains all of the elements of another, subset. To prove this show that for each element $x\in A$, $x\in B$

$A = B$ if every A contains every elements of B, and vice versa. Therefor $A \subset B$ and $B \subset A$. If a set contains no elements, it is called the [[./empty_set.org][empty set]] and is denoted by $\emptyset$.
