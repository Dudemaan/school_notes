A linear system is a collection (set) of [[./linear_equations.org][linear equations]] where the value of each variable is consistent across all equations. An example can be seen below:

$$ \begin{cases} x + y + z + w = 6 \\ y + z + w = 4 \\ y + w = 2 \end{cases} $$

In this case x would be 2, z would be 2, and y and w have infinite values so long as w=2-y.
