#+title: Lists

Lists are close to equivelant to arrays in python. They store a series of objects starting at index 0, going to index: total number of items in list - 1. They can also be reference starting at the end of the list using [-1] for the last item, [-2] for the second last, and so on.

.insert() -> choose a point in the array to add an element

    my_arr.insert(2, "test")

del -> remove an element from a list

    del my_arr[2]

When setting two lists equal to eachother, they point to the same point in memory, creating an alias.

    a = [1, 2]
    b = a
    b[1] = "monkey"
    print("a[1]") == "monkey"
